# Password Generator

This project generates a random password that includes letters, numbers, and symbols. 

The password is designed to be secure by including a random mix of different character types.

- **Description:**

    - **Character Pools:** The generator uses predefined lists of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
	- **Random Selection:** It randomly determines how many letters, symbols, and numbers to include within a specified range.
	- **Password Construction:** The generator constructs the password by randomly selecting characters from each pool and then shuffling the resultant list to ensure randomness.
	- **Output:** The final password is a string composed by concatenating the shuffled list of characters.
