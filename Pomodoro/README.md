# Pomodoro Timer

This project implements a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI).

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

- **Description:**

	- **Constants and Variables:** The script defines color constants and timing intervals for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
	- **Timer Functions:**
      - reset_timer(): Resets the timer and the GUI to the initial state.
      - start_timer(): Starts the timer and determines whether itâ€™s time for a work session, short break, or long break based on the number of repetitions.
      - count_down(count): Manages the countdown mechanism and updates the GUI every second.
    - **User Interface Setup:** The GUI includes a timer display, start and reset buttons, and labels for visual feedback.
    - **Visual Feedback:** A tomato image is used as a visual cue for the timer, and check marks are displayed to indicate completed work sessions.

Overall, the Pomodoro Timer provides a functional and user-friendly interface to help manage time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique.
